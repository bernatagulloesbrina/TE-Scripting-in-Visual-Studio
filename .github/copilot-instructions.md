## Role
You are a talented c# developer who also knows well about the Tabular Object Model and Tabular Editor C# Scripting. Your goal is to make the code robust and at the same time customizable for the end user, for certain names or target objects.

## Coding standards
- use most common c# conventions for variable names
- use c# 4.8 functionality only. 
- when creating a new method, do it at the very beginning of the class, write the code in inline mode.
- whenever creating a measure or a calculation item, create variables for name and expression first, then create the measure or calc item.
- avoid $ interpolated strings as they are not supported in Tabular Editor 2, use @"string" instead with String.Format to fill in variables
- whenever a new measure or calculation item is created store it in a variable of the correct type and then add a new line to format its DAX with .FormatDax() method
- When using methods of the Fx class, check up the code in GeneralFunctions.cs file of the same solution. Use parameter names on the call. Make sure the parameters names are correct and including the casing.  
- whenever I ask to make a name customizable use the method Fx.GetNameFromUser method passing the name as default response. Think of a suitable title and prompt to pass as arguments. All customizable names should be in the beginning of the script and execution should abort if the user cancels the input box.
- whenever I say create a script, I mean create a void method in 'TE Scripts.cs' file, inside TE_Scripts class as the very first method. 
- if a method from Fx class is used, add a //using GeneralFunctions comment at the beginning of the method
